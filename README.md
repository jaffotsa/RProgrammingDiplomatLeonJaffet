# Econometrics in R
Hey! Here I'm going to share with you code in R to understand and apply Econometrics and Advanced Statistics

Here you will learn how to apply in R:

## Hypothesis test, non parametric (Wilcoxon, Mannâ€“Whitney U, Friedman, Kruskal-Wallis etc...)
## Hypothesis test, parametricANOVA classical and Advanced and Tukey Test
## Simple Linear Regression
## Multiple Simple Linear Regression
## Robust Regression (Yohai Regression, Huber etc...)
## Mixed Linear Models
## Survival Analysis
## GAM
## Regression Tree

You'll find simple vectors with toy data to practice! And I will add in the future AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA and Robust Correlation ;)

Cheers!
