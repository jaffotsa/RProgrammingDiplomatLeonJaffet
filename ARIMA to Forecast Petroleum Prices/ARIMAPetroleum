# We're going to analyze the prices for Crude Oil for members of the OPEC. The data used for this code es available at: https://asb.opec.org/data/ASB_Data.php
# For this case, I used the Data available for monthly prices for "Mexico Istmo", between january 1983 and december 2019

# NOTE: We already know the prices for 2020 (even negative), but in order to show you how to develop an ARIMA model in R, we're gong to "forecast" 2020 prices

# Estimemos un modelo ARIMA para proyectar
# el precio del petroleo
